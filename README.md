Run the most rescent 'Main' file in chuck while the arduino is connected.

If it does not run, double check your port numbers in the code for the arduino :

it is usually 0 for the pi and 2 for a mac

Note : 

The optimized arduino and chuck code is still a work in progress dont use, it will break your shit
